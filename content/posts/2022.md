Welcome to 2020, part II.

I [intended to write](../2020) a lot more in 2021 than I actually did.

<!--more-->

Call it
[COVID fatigue](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/covid-fatigue)
or something else (I had a _much_ busier H2 in 2021 than I expected due to a
role and team change), but I just didn't manage to write much - I had a lot of
half thoughts, and they ended up either in an ever growing set of drafts or
just lazily thrown on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/matanlurey).

For 2022, I am setting specific professional goals for myself:

1. Attend at least 1 conference a quarter, on average.[^1]
1. Read a technical or organizational leadership book 1x a month.
1. Write into an internal newsletter 2x a month.
1. Write a personal blog entry 1x a week (yes, this counts).
1. Decide on a long-term career plan for 2023+.

[^1]: Contingent on how comfortable I feel traveling visa-vi COVID.

Stay tuned for more :)
